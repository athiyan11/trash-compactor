# Solar powered trash compactor and receptor

 A trash compactor is mechanical system used to reduce the size of material such
as waste material or bio mass through compaction. This project is working
prototype of a solar powered receptacle and trash compactor for minimizing the
over spill of waste in the bin. The main aim of our project is implementing better
bin space efficiency and cost-effective waste collection to maintain a healthy
environment. Our project is powered by solar energy for outdoor and AC plugin
for indoor that uses integrated infrared and ultrasonic sensors to detect the trash
level inside the trash containment unit and leverages linear actuators to compress
and compact the collected garbage, thereby yielding space optimization and
energy efficiency and link them to ubidots for monitoring the garbage over the
internet.
